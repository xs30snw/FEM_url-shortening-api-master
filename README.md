# Frontend Mentor - URL Shortening API Master â€” Work in progress

This is a solution to [URL shortening API landing page challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/url-shortening-api-landing-page-2ce3ob-G).
- A user gets to see a landing page, and also should be able to shorten their links by using [https://shrtco.de/](https://shrtco.de/) API;
- The app is made with React.js, and an additional react library [react-copy-to-clipboard](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-copy-to-clipboard);
- Social network icons imported from [icons8](https://maxst.icons8.com). 

The project deployed to GitHub with the help of *react-gh-pages* package. The master branch contains the app's source code (the code the app's developers edit), and the gh-pages branch contains a built version of the app (i.e. the code that GitHub Pages serves to the app's visitors).
